<b>Crypto Mesh Node (CMN) - Alpha</b><br><br>

Crypto Mesh Node is a peer-to-peer messaging, broadcasting, and decentralized puzzle-solving application focused on privacy, community collaboration, and blockchain integration.<br><br>

Our main mission is solving advanced Bitcoin puzzles — a process we call <b>mining</b>.  
Each puzzle range is broken into <b>28 chunks</b>, and the target key exists somewhere inside one of these chunks. One person alone could never scan the entire range effectively, but a community working together makes it possible.<br><br>

CMN distributes the workload across all active nodes, allowing the network to collectively scan <b>billions of keys per second</b>.<br><br>

<b>Mining Rewards:</b><br>
Each active worker contributes to the scanning effort.  
You earn <b>0.01 CM</b> per active worker every few minutes as long as your workers remain online and active.<br><br>

<b>Community Puzzle Reward:</b><br>
If the network successfully solves the Bitcoin puzzle, the full reward is automatically <b>split between all CM coin holders</b>, proportional to their balance.<br><br>

<b>Masternodes & Network Stability:</b><br>
Starting a masternode helps keep the network fully decentralized.  
Each masternode holds important operational data required to keep the network running smoothly, ensure message propagation, manage miner coordination, and maintain overall system stability.  
The more masternodes running, the stronger and more resilient the CMN network becomes.<br><br>
